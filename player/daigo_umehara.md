Also known as "The Beast". Twitch's first global ambassador, 
sponsored by Red Bull、HyperX、Cy Games、NSURGO in 2017.
Currently holds a world record of "the most successful player 
in major tournaments of Street Fighter" in Guinness World Records. 

Considered the strongest Street Fighter player in long set (FT7-FT10) 
where he has time to prepare for specific character/player match up. 
He beat Infiltration, Xian, Momochi and Tokido in a long set convincingly 
after they won EVO.

Outside of competing Daigo is also doing a lot of side project with his BeasTV twitch channel, 
like Donation Colosseum or Kemonomichi where he setup an exhibition match that people wanted to see.
