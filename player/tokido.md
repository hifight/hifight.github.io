Also known as “Murder Face”. Tokyo University graduated pro gamer. 

Tokido was known for competing in multiple fighting games, using only strong characters and strong tactics to get many high places on multiple games in tournament. 
However, Tokido decided to change his approach toward fighting games after 2 important 
events, watching Infiltration losing to Daigo Umehara and him losing to Momochi in Topanga League even though he had 6-1 lead. 

Tokido stopped competing in other games and focus only on Street Fighter series since then. 
Tokido decided to stick to Akuma in Ultra Street Fighter IV even though he was not considered top tier anymore. 
When Akuma came out in season 2 of Street Fighter V, 
Tokido also stated right away that he will only use Akuma in CPT 2017 and see how far he can go, 
which lead him to his big win at EVO 2017 and second place at Capcom Cup 2017.
