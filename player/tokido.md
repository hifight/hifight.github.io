Also known as “Murder Face”. Tokyo University graduated pro gamer. Tokido was known for competing in multiple fighting games, using only strong characters and strong tactics to get many high places on multiple games in tournament. 

However, Tokido decided to change his approach toward fighting games after 2 important events, watching Infiltration losing to Daigo Umehara and him losing to Momochi in Topanga League even though he had 6-1 lead. Tokido stopped competing in other games and focus only on Street Fighter series since then.
