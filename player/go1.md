The best MELTY BLOOD Act Cadenza and Dragon Ball FighterZ of all time. 
Go1 is known for his skill in defensing opponent attack with reaction 
to the level where people saying that he bully his opponent by just blocking.

At the end of the year, Go1 was signed by team CYCLOPS OSAKA athlete gaming and became full time pro gamer.

In Street Fighter V, Go1 was using Chun-Li in season 1 and Ibuki in season 2. 
At first it was pretty clear that he wanted to use mainly top tier characters. 
But when Menat came out, Go1 was the only player who could play her at top level 
in a very short time and decided to choose her as one of his main. 
In season 3, Go1 dropped Ibuki and only uses Chun-Li and Menat.

Go1 is the most dominant player in Dragon Ball FighterZ. 
Before the tournament season, Go1 was winning every tournament in Japan 
while SonicFox was winning in USA. After the 'You're next, SonicFox' callout from Go1, 
their exhibition was set at Final Round 2018.
