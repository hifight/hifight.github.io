hifight: Execution, Optimization, Menat
---

Player who has the best execution in fighting games history.
One of five Japanese fighting games gods. Capcom Cup 2013 champion.
The scientist who always develop his characters to the new level that no one else can, 
like Bulleta in Vampire Savior, Eddie in Guilty Gear XX and Menat in Street Fighter V.

Sako has been playing fighting games since the old days 
but many people got to know him for his GODSGARDEN fight with Daigo Umehara in Super Street Fighter IV 
where he came back from 0-5 to 8-6 with his incredible Cammy. 
Sako was changing his main multiple times throughtout SFIV, 
even though he won Capcom Cup 2013 with Evil Ryu but a lot of people is a fan of his Cammy or Ibuki too.

In Street Fighter V, Sako main Chun-Li in season 1 and Akuma in season 2.
He was doing well and able to get into Capcom Cup for both seasons.
After season 2 ended, Sako immediately switch his main to Menat even though Akuma is still considered one of the top tier.
With Sako execution skill and creativity, he has been showing multiple Menat V-Trigger I setup that no other players have used before 
and many of those are difficult enough that we might only see Sako performs in tournament.
