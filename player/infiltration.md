Street Fighter IV, V and Street Fighter x Tekken multiple EVO Champion. 
One of the strongest Akuma and Decapre who can play almost all the cast 
in Street Fighter IV. Main Nash in the 1st season of SFV but changed to Juri and Menat in S2.

After Street Fighter V came out in 2016, the first half of CPT 2016 was completely dominated by Infiltration.
He won almost every tournament that he went to including EVO. 
The only player who finally stopped his win streak was Tokido at CEO 2016 
and it took Tokido a lot of tournament before he beat Infiltration that one time.

In season 2, Nash was getting nerf heavily and Infiltration was having character crisis. 
He was changing character a lot from Nash to Karin, Rashid etc. but couldn't get a big win 
until the later half of that year where he started using only Juri and won a ranking tournament 
with her by beating 3 top level Rashid.

After Capcom Cup 2017 Infiltration changed his main to Menat while using Juri 
as a sub character for fighting Rashid, and he won big tournament like EVO Japan 2018 and 
Final Round 2018 right away.
