hifight: The Alpha, Da God, Hit Confirm
---

The Alpha. Known for his whiff punish and hit confirm reaction 
that are definitely one of the best in the world. 
In Japanese news on EVO 2017, they refer to Punk as 'The machine who plays on pad like SNK CPU'.

Punk made his breakout appearance on CPT 2016 NA Regional Finals, 
where he qualified via online tournaments but he beat Fillipino Champ, 
Chris Tatarian and Justin Wong 3-0, but lost in winner's final to Tokido and 
got eliminated by NuckleDu.

In 2017 Punk has finished top 16 at 5 Premier Events. 
Three of those finishes were first place at NCR and Dreamhack Austin in back to back 
wins and at the very last event of the year at Red Bull Battle Grounds.
He didn't lose a single game to anyone at EVO 2017 except to Tokido who put him at 2nd place.

Outside of Street Fighter V, Punk also plays Injustice 2, Marvel vs Capcom Infinite and Dragon Ball FighterZ as well.
