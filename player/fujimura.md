Fujimura (aka Yukadon) is multiple CPT premiere tournament champion, 
got top 8 at EVO2016, Capcom Cup 2016 and 2017, considered one of the best Street Fighter V player 
by many top level players in Japan. He is known for his skill in choosing and performing optimized combo for 
any situation and always surprise everyone on how he finish his opponent.

Fujimura was very strong C.Viper player in Street Fighter IV under the gamertag "isesuto" 
(he lived in the city called Ise)
but he rarely went to tournament and mostly made his name through online and streaming. 
There was famous long set between isesuto (C.Viper) and Mago (Oni) where they played for 8 hours 
and isesuto won 118-59 against Mago. 

The name Yukadon is coming from ground pound move of his character (C.Viper), 
where yuka means floor and don is the sound of hitting the floor. 
Unfortunately, the name can also be interpreted similar to the word Kabedon (Kabe = wall) 
and Fujimura decided to use his real name when he got sponsored by team Fudoh to separate from that nuance.

After Street Fighter V came out, Yukadon was moving to MOV gaming house, Tokiwasou (aka Heiwajima), 
and started competeting more in tournament with Nash. He made his first tournament win at RAGE Genbu Cup 
where he beat the Capcom Cup 2015 Champion, Kazunoko. Then he immediately made his name globally by 
getting 3rd place at EVO2016, his first overseas tournament. After that he got sponsored by YOUDEAL 
and became full time pro-gamer.

In season 2, Fujimura changed his main from Nash to Ibuki, one of the strongest character, and won 3 premiere tournament during 2017.
Although Ibuki is not as strong in season 3, he decided to continue using her and made his big win at Stunfest 2018 
where he beat Infiltration in grand final 6-0, showing many optimized Ibuki technique that no one have seen before.
