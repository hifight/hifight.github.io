HiFightTH is a twitter account I created for sharing fighting games highlight, 
funny moments and sometimes fighting games related news. 
I love watching fighting games and get so hype that I could not keep that to myself, 
that's where I thought that I should share those feeling to everyone.

I started fighting games highlight blog back in 2015 (on this website)
and mainly sharing the blog only in Thai FGC facebook until around the time 
Street Fighter V came out where I moved to twitter completely and stopped updating this website for a long time.

Then I had some idea (and free time) about organizing my completely unorganized twitter clips 
and thought that it would be cool if we can find players highlight more easily, 
And that's where my new updated blog is coming from. 

If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave messages on my 
twitter page <a href="https://twitter.com/HiFightTH">@HiFightTH</a> 
or via <a href="mailto:hifight.th@gmail.com">hifight.th@gmail.com</a> .
And don't forget to follow for more highlight!
