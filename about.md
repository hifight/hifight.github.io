<h2>About</h2>

HiFightTH is a twitter account I created for sharing fighting games highlight, 
funny moments and sometimes fighting game related news. 
I love watching fighting games and get so hype that I could not just keep that to myself 
and feel like sharing those amazing moment to everyone.

I started fighting games highlight blog back in 2015 (on this same url)
and mainly share highlight in my local FGC facebook page until around the time 
Street Fighter V came out, where I decided to create the twitter account and started sharing highlight more globally.

Then I had some idea (and free time) on organizing my completely unorganized twitter clips and gifs on one place.
I thought that it would be cool if people can find players highlight more easily and I was having fun looking at random gifs 
while working on this project, which all resulted in the current state of this website.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave messages on my 
twitter page <a href="https://twitter.com/HiFightTH">@HiFightTH</a> 
or via <a href="mailto:hifight.th@gmail.com">hifight.th@gmail.com</a>.
And don't forget to follow for more highlight!
