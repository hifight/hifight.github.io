<h2><center>FOOTSIES</center></h2>

FOOTSIES is a 2D fighting game where players can control character movement horizontally 
and use one attack button to perform normal and special moves.
While the controls (and graphics) are super simple, 
FOOTSIES retains the fundamental feeling of fighting game genre 
where spacing, hit confirming and whiff punishing are keys to achieve victory.

This is a fun little project where I decided to create everything on the game myself,
even though I am super bad art and music, it went really well with how simple the gameplay is. 
The animation in this game are, obviously, heavily inspired by the most iconic you-know-who fighting game character.

Although I mostly tested this game with CPU, when I actually tried this game with my friend, 
we actually had a lot of fun! So, I hope that everyone can this game and have some fun as well :D
