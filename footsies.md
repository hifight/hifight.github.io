FOOTSIES is a 2D fighting game where players can control character movement horizontally 
and use one attack button to perform normal and special moves to defeat their opponent.
While the controls (and graphics) are super simple, 
FOOTSIES retains the fundamental feeling of fighting game genre 
where spacing, hit confirm and whiff punish are keys to achieve victory.

This is a fun little project for the fighting game community and 
for own practice developing a game by myself.
I am objectively bad at art and music but that went kinda well with theme of the game. 
The animation in this game are, obviously, heavily inspired by the most iconic you-know-who fighting game character.

Although I only tested this game mostly with CPU, when I actually tried this game with my friend, 
we actually had a lot of fun! So, I hope that everyone try this game and have some fun as well :D
